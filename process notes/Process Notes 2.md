# Discovering the HP Reveal App
---

I followed the [link](https://aurasma.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206283375-Creating-an-Aurasma-studio-account) on how to start creating an augmented reality experience in the FAQ.
- I downloaded the app onto my phone
- I then created an account with HP Reveal
- I followed the tutorial instructions to practice making an augmented reality experience
    - It works by taking a picture of the object you wish to tie the augmented aspect to
    - You then can select the augmented aspect and place it on the object
    - Once you are done you can either make it public or save it privately on your account
- I then played around with the ones made public in the app's library to further understand how it works

I really like the concept of using technology to reveal a hidden aspect of a physical object, it feels almost like magic.
