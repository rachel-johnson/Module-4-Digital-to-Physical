# Converting the 3d Model
---

After figuring out how the HP Reveal App works, I began to build my own AR experience.

- I followed the instruction from the page ["How to Create An Aura"](https://aurasma.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205584239-Studio-How-To-Create-An-Aura) in order to figure out how to incorporate my 3d model
- I also followed Professor Graham's instructions in the FAQ to use [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net) to make my 3d model compatible with HP Reveal
    - I downloaded MeshLab 
    - I then opened by .obj file from my 3d model in Module 1 in MeshLab
        - It took me a little while to figure out how to do this, but I eventually located the correct file on my computer to do it
    - I then exported the file as Collada .dae format in order for it to be compatible with the app
