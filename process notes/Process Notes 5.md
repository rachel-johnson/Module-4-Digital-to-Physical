# Issues and Finishing the Experience
---
When trying to add my 3d model in the .tar file as an aura in HP Reveal I ran into some problems
- It kept coming up as unable to add the .tar file, as there was an issue with the thumbnail file
- After trying a couple of different things I decided to leave it as just the sonification as the aura
- I found a picture of Churchill wearing a similar style hat to the Toby Jug, with a cigar in his mouth and similar clothing as well
- I then added my sonification and an image of the Toby Jug as auras to the picture
    - I purposely lined up the Toby Jug with the Churchill image, so to have the Jug overlay the image
    - I wanted to show the way in which he was depicted in mass culture in 1940's England
- I then saved the Experience, and tested it out using the HP Reveal App
- I am very happy with the end result, but would like to figure out how to make a 3d model work with the app
