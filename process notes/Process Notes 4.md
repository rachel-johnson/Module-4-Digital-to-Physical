# Making a VR Experience
---

Following the instructions on the FAQ, after making a .dae file, I then had to create a .tar file.

- I looked at the information on the [HP Reveal page](https://aurasma.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382776-3D-Overlay-Specifications-formerly-3D-Guidelines-) about adding 3d models 
- I realized I needed multiple files within the .tar file
- I saw that you can add .mp3 sound files and decided to use my Module 3 sound as well
    - I converted the .wav file of my sonification into a .mp3 file
- I then created a VR experience using the HP Reveal app in which the sonification plays when you use the app on your phone to view a specific picture of Churchill
    - I tested it and it worked really well
- I then tried to create the .tar file in order to use my 3d model as the aura
    - I found the .png texture files and .png thumbnail images from my Module 1
    - I compressed them into a .tar file using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) 
- I added the audio file and the .tar file as auras onto a picture of Churchill
